Design Patterns in C++

## SOLID Principle
### SRP: Single Responsibility Principle
- A class should only have one reason to change
- Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

### OCP: Open-Close Principle
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

### LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle
- You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

### ISP: Interface Segregation Principle
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces

### DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle
- High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions

## GOF Patterns
### Creational Patterns
#### AbstractFactory Pattern
#### FactoryMethod Pattern
#### Singleton
#### Prototype
### Behavioral Patterns
### Structural Patterns
